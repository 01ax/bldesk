# Keyboard shortcuts

Cmd+F, or Ctrl+Shift+F, inside an embedded SSH session opens scrollback search. Plain Ctrl+F is left to the session (forward-char in a shell, a page down in vim and less). Find next and Previous navigate matches; Escape closes the find bar. See [Terminal](help:terminal).

Use Cmd on macOS and Ctrl on Windows or Linux for the command palette and desktop zoom.

## Palette
- Cmd/Ctrl+K opens or closes the palette. It does not open while a dialog is open.
- Up and Down select a result.
- Tab accepts the current completion.
- Enter opens a result or advances an action to its review.
- Enter again runs a reviewed action when its required fields are complete.
- Escape backs out of the current palette state or closes it.

Read the [palette grammar](help:palette). A non-mutating navigation action does not need two confirmations.

## Zoom
- Cmd/Ctrl+plus or equals: zoom in.
- Cmd/Ctrl+minus: zoom out.
- Cmd/Ctrl+0: reset to 100%.

Desktop zoom steps are 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 125% and 150%. The View menu uses the same bounds. Below 768 CSS pixels wide, the desktop sidebar is hidden: use the bottom navigation's More button to open the drawer and scroll to other pages. This includes a 1024-pixel-wide window at 150%, but not a 1280-pixel-wide window at 150%. Map zoom changes the map, not the whole application.

## Dialogs and help
Escape closes the dialog on top when it is idle and has a close button; busy dialogs prevent accidental dismissal, and the dialog that asks for an answer about an action stays until it is answered or put off with Decide later. Enter submits forms when valid, and holding it down does not repeat. Tab and Shift+Tab stay inside the open dialog, and closing it puts focus back where it was.

In Help, Up and Down choose a suggestion; Enter accepts it into the search box. Press Enter to submit a query explicitly. Escape dismisses suggestions.

In a firewall-matrix tag editor, Enter adds the typed tag and Escape closes the editor. In a Network inline field, Enter commits and Escape cancels editing. Escape also dismisses the server context menu and update popover.

## Desktop tools
F5 reloads the desktop renderer; Cmd+R also reloads on macOS. F12 opens developer tools; Cmd+Option+I does the same on macOS. Native menus display the platform's standard editing, reload and window shortcuts.

Server-list j/k, single-key SSH/restart and slash-to-filter are proposed features, not implemented shortcuts. Do not rely on them.
